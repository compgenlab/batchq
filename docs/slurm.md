# Running on a SLURM cluster

The SLURM runner is one of the original motivations for batchq (see
[overview](overview.md#why-batchq-exists) for the others). It lets you
queue a much larger backlog of jobs in batchq than your shared
cluster's admins want you putting into the SLURM queue directly, then
submits them into SLURM at a controlled rate as capacity becomes
available.

SLURM itself doesn't impose a per-user job cap — a single-user cluster
can happily hold tens of thousands of jobs. But admins of shared
clusters routinely configure a per-user `MaxJobs` (and similar) limit
because one user's huge backlog degrades scheduler responsiveness for
everyone else. The SLURM runner exists to be a good citizen on those
clusters: hold the backlog locally in batchq, feed SLURM at whatever
rate the local policy permits.

The runner is the **only** component that talks to SLURM. The batchq
server itself does not know SLURM exists — it just sees a runner that
claims jobs, eventually moves them to `PROXYQUEUED`, and later reports
their terminal status. This is a permanent deployment invariant: the
batchq server and the SLURM head node may live on different clusters,
and reconciliation never moves server-side.

## What the SLURM runner does

The SLURM runner has two jobs on every invocation, and both matter:

1. **Submit.** Take batchq jobs that are in `QUEUED`, generate an
   sbatch script, hand them off to SLURM with `sbatch`, and move them
   into `PROXYQUEUED`. This is the obvious half — the throttled
   submission side of "feed SLURM a huge backlog politely."

2. **Reconcile.** For every batchq job currently in `PROXYQUEUED`,
   poll `squeue` / `sacct` for the SLURM-side state and report any
   terminal outcome (SUCCESS, FAILED, CANCELED, exit code, end time,
   `afterok` dependents) back to the batchq server.

The reconciliation half is the one that's easy to overlook, and it's
the only way batchq ever learns that a SLURM job finished. The batchq
server has no other channel into SLURM — if nothing is calling
`squeue` / `sacct` on its behalf, every `PROXYQUEUED` job stays
`PROXYQUEUED` forever, even after it has long since finished on the
cluster.

This is the real reason cron is the right shape for the SLURM runner.
Even on a day when you have nothing new to submit, you still need
something firing the runner periodically so that the reconciliation
step happens and the queue keeps moving. See
[Three ways to drive it](#three-ways-to-drive-it) below.

## When to use it

Use the SLURM runner when:

- You're on a shared SLURM cluster where admins have set a per-user
  `MaxJobs` limit, or you want to be polite about not flooding the
  queue even where there is no hard cap.
- You want to submit a pipeline of thousands of jobs from one place,
  with `afterok` dependencies, without managing the SLURM queue
  yourself.
- You want a persistent record of every job you ever submitted, with
  its inputs and outputs tagged, that outlives SLURM's job-accounting
  retention.

Use the simple runner instead when you just want jobs to run on the
host the runner is on (a workstation, a single shared server, or a
compute node you have grabbed for the day).

## Deployment topology

The pieces and where they run:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────────┐
│  Login node / submit host       │    │  SLURM head node         │
│                                 │    │                          │

│  batchq run --slurm  ─── REST over socket ─────┘
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

In most clusters the same node is the login node and the SLURM submit
host, so batchq server, the SLURM runner, the SLURM client binaries,
and the user's CLIs all live there. On clusters where the SLURM head
is a different host than where users land, the SLURM runner needs to
be where `sbatch` works.

The database file (`batchq.db`) goes on a networked filesystem so
every cluster node sees the same queue. The socket (`batchq.sock`)
goes on a *local* filesystem — `/tmp` or similar — because unix
sockets do not work reliably on NFS. The batchq server's `[server]
listen` can point at a local-disk socket while `[server] db` points at
the networked database.

The batchq server is **not** a long-running daemon in this picture.
Clients spawn one on demand with a short idle timeout, and overlapping
requests from the user's CLIs and from `batchq run --slurm` are
funneled through that one process so the database stays safe.

## Running the SLURM runner

A single-pass invocation looks like this:

```sh
batchq run --slurm \
  --slurm-user $USER \
  --slurm-account acct123 \
  --slurm-partition general \
  --slurm-max-jobs 200
```

Or set the same values in config and just run `batchq run --slurm`:

```toml
[batchq]
runner = "slurm"             # makes --slurm the default for `batchq run`

[slurm_runner]
user = "myuser"
account = "acct123"
partition = "general"
max_jobs = 0                 # 0 / unset = unlimited submissions per invocation
max_slurm_jobs = 200         # cap on this user's live SLURM-queue jobs
```

The runner loops as follows:

1. **Check the SLURM queue depth.** Calls `squeue` for the configured
   user; if the live job count is at `max_slurm_jobs`, sleep and
   retry.
2. **Reconcile.** For every batchq job currently in `PROXYQUEUED`,
   call `squeue` / `sacct` to see whether it finished. If it did,
   report its terminal status back to the batchq server.
3. **Submit.** Claim the next eligible batchq job (atomic
   `QUEUED → RUNNING` on the server, then immediately `RUNNING →
   PROXYQUEUED` after `sbatch` returns), generate an sbatch script
   from its details, and shell out to `sbatch`.
4. **Repeat.**

With `--forever`, this loop runs indefinitely. Without `--forever`, it
runs one reconciliation + submission pass and exits.

## What gets translated to SLURM

A batchq job submitted with the usual flags becomes an sbatch
invocation that looks roughly like:

```sh
sbatch \
  --job-name <name> \
  --cpus-per-task <procs> \
  --mem <mem> \
  --time <walltime> \
  --chdir <wd> \
  --output <stdout-with-%j-substituted> \
  --error <stderr-with-%j-substituted> \
  --account <account> \
  --partition <partition> \
  [--dependency afterok:<slurm-id>:<slurm-id>...] \
  [--export=<captured-env>] \
  <generated-script>
```

Notes:

- **stdout/stderr placeholders.** batchq's `%JOBID` placeholder is
  rewritten to SLURM's `%j` when the sbatch script is generated.
- **Dependencies.** When a batchq job has `afterok` dependencies on
  jobs that the SLURM runner already submitted, those dependencies are
  translated to `--dependency afterok:<slurm-id>:...`. The runner
  knows the SLURM job id for each PROXYQUEUED batchq job (it stores it
  as a running detail) and looks it up when generating dependency
  flags.
- **Environment.** If the batchq job was submitted with `--env` (or
  `#BATCHQ -env`, or an `--export=ALL` SBATCH header), the captured
  environment is passed to sbatch.
- **Resources.** Generic `--resource` requirements that came from a
  `--gres`/`-C` SBATCH header are matched against what the SLURM runner
  advertises (typically a cluster label) before the job is claimed —
  they decide *which* runner submits the job, not the `sbatch` flags.
  procs/mem/walltime are what `sbatch` actually enforces. See
  [Generic resources](resources.md).

### Job arrays

A batchq job array is handed to SLURM as a **single** array submission,
not one `sbatch` per task. The runner claims a batch of the array's tasks
(bounded by `max_jobs` / `max_slurm_jobs` so a large array is drip-fed),
submits them as one `sbatch --array=<indices>%N`, and records each task's
SLURM array id and task index. Reconciliation is symmetric: a single
`sacct -j <arrayid>` reports the state of every task. A whole-array
`batchq cancel <array-id>` issues `scancel <slurm_array_id>`; cancelling
one task issues `scancel <slurm_array_id>_<index>`. The `%N` throttle
becomes sbatch's native `%N`. See [Job arrays](job-arrays.md).

## Throttling

Two knobs control the submission rate:

- **`max_slurm_jobs` (`--slurm-max-jobs`).** The maximum number of
  this user's jobs that may exist in the SLURM queue at once. The
  runner polls `squeue` before every submission and waits if the live
  count is at the limit. On a shared cluster, set this to your
  cluster's per-user `MaxJobs` policy minus a margin; on a cluster
  with no cap, set it to whatever you think is polite.
- **`max_jobs` (`--max-jobs`).** A cap on how many jobs this runner
  invocation submits before exiting. Mostly useful for cron-driven
  setups; with `--forever`, leave it unset.

## Failure handling

- A failed `sbatch` (non-zero exit, network blip) leaves the batchq
  job back in `QUEUED` for the next pass.
- A SLURM job that ends with a non-zero exit code is reported back to
  batchq as `FAILED` with the exit code in its running details. Its
  `afterok` descendants are cancelled with reason "parent failed".
- A SLURM job that is cancelled (`scancel`, time-out, node failure)
  is reported back as `CANCELED`. Descendants are cancelled with
  reason "parent canceled".
- A `sacct` lag where SLURM reports "unknown" for a recently-completed
  job does **not** mark the batchq job FAILED — the runner records the
  reason and tries again later. (See commit `fae265f`.)

## Recovering orphaned claims

There is one narrow way a job can get *stuck* rather than fail cleanly,
and the runner has an opt-in pass to fix it.

**How a claim orphans.** When the runner claims a job it moves it
`QUEUED → RUNNING`, then runs `sbatch`, then records the SLURM id and
moves it `RUNNING → PROXYQUEUED`. The claim commits on the server *even if
the client's request is cancelled* — the server deliberately decouples
from request cancellation so a mid-write disconnect can't corrupt the DB.
On a slow-IOPS networked filesystem (Lustre/NFS), a claim can therefore
commit on the server while the runner's request times out on the client
side. The runner never receives the task list, so it never `sbatch`es and
never records a SLURM id — leaving the job **`RUNNING` with no slurm id**.
Nothing advances it after that: there's no SLURM job to reconcile, and the
normal claim path won't re-claim a `RUNNING` job.

**How recovery works.** Run the SLURM runner with an orphan-recovery flag
and, before it claims new work, it lists `RUNNING` jobs, identifies the
orphans, and re-drives them through the normal submit path (array-task
orphans are regrouped by their batchq array id and re-submitted as one
`sbatch --array`). A job is only treated as an orphan when **all** of these
hold, so recovery can never double-submit live work:

- status `RUNNING` with **no** `slurm_job_id`/`slurm_array_id` — a job
  that already reached `sbatch` is never re-driven;
- older than a few minutes — so a handoff still legitimately in flight in
  a concurrent pass isn't mistaken for a dead one;
- **attributable to this runner** — see the two flags below.

### `--slurm-recover-orphans` (host-keyed — the safe default)

Re-drives only orphans whose recorded **`host`** claim detail matches this
runner's host. Matching the host is how the runner proves the orphan is
*its own* leftover and not, say, a job another runner is legitimately
executing. Because ownership is positively identified, this is safe even
when other runners share the same batchq server.

Its blind spot: an orphan that carries **no host at all** can never match,
so it is left alone. That happens with claims made by a build that predated
host recording, or a handoff that died before the host was persisted.

### `--slurm-recover-hostless` (sole-claimant deployments only)

A **superset** of the host-keyed flag: it does everything the above does,
*and* re-drives orphans that have **no recorded host**, attributing them to
this runner by the age gate alone. Enabling it also turns the recovery pass
on, so you only need this one flag — not both.

The trade-off: with no host there is nothing to distinguish your orphan
from another runner's, so this is **only safe when this runner is the sole
thing claiming jobs against the server** — the normal single-cron-runner
SLURM deployment. (It still never re-drives a job whose recorded host
belongs to a *different* runner; the risk is confined to hostless jobs.)
Don't enable it if a simple runner, or a second SLURM runner, also claims
against the same server.

| Orphan (RUNNING, no slurm id, aged) | `--slurm-recover-orphans` | `--slurm-recover-hostless` |
|---|---|---|
| host matches this runner | recovers | recovers |
| host is a *different* runner's | ignores | ignores |
| **no host recorded** | ignores | **recovers** (by age) |
| Safe alongside other runners? | yes | no — sole claimant only |

Both are off by default. Configure via `[slurm_runner] recover_orphans` /
`recover_hostless`, or the matching flags. On the recommended single cron
runner (see below), adding `--slurm-recover-hostless` makes stuck jobs
self-heal on the next pass with no manual intervention.

## Three ways to drive it

You can run `batchq run --slurm` in any of three shapes. The
reconciliation loop is exactly the same in each — the difference is
just how often it fires and who starts it.

### Manually, from a shell

Type the command at a prompt and watch it run:

```sh
batchq run --slurm --max-jobs 10
```

The runner reconciles every `PROXYQUEUED` job, submits up to ten new
ones to SLURM, and exits. You get your prompt back when it's done.

This shape is right for ad-hoc work: pushing a small batch into SLURM
by hand, watching what a single reconciliation pass actually does
before automating it, debugging a misconfigured job, or just kicking
the runner once after a manual `batchq release`. You can also run it
this way day-to-day if you don't mind being the one keeping things
moving — but remember that the runner does both submission *and*
reconciliation in one pass, so a `PROXYQUEUED` job that finishes on
the cluster won't show up as `SUCCESS` in batchq until the next time
you run the command.

### From cron (recommended on shared clusters)

The shape you want for steady-state work on a shared HPC cluster: a
single-pass invocation, wrapped in a lockfile, fired by cron every few
minutes. No permanent process, no SSH session to keep alive, no
`tmux` to detach.

This is the right shape for the SLURM runner specifically because of
the reconciliation half of the runner's work — even when there's
nothing new to submit, you still need somebody firing the runner so
that already-`PROXYQUEUED` jobs get their status updated as they
finish on the cluster. Cron does that for you for free.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
LOCK=$HOME/jobs/batchq_slurm_runner.lock
LOG=$HOME/jobs/batchq_slurm_runner.log

if [ ! -e "$LOCK" ]; then
    echo $$ > "$LOCK"
    {
        echo "--"
        date
        batchq run --slurm \
            --max-jobs 50 \
            --slurm-account MYACCT \
            --slurm-max-jobs 475 \
            --slurm-recover-hostless
    } &>> "$LOG"
    rm "$LOCK"
fi
```

Drop that into `~/jobs/batchq_slurm_runner.sh` and add it to your
crontab. Every five minutes is a reasonable cadence — SLURM job state
doesn't change fast enough to need finer granularity, and the lockfile
shrugs off the occasional run that takes longer than the interval:

```cron
*/5 * * * * ~/jobs/batchq_slurm_runner.sh
```

The pattern in this example:

- **`--max-jobs 50`** caps the number of jobs this one invocation
  moves from `QUEUED` → `PROXYQUEUED`. Even with a huge batchq
  backlog and plenty of SLURM headroom, no single cron tick pushes
  more than fifty new jobs into SLURM.
- **`--slurm-max-jobs 475`** is the ceiling on this user's total
  live SLURM jobs (anything visible to `squeue` for the user). Before
  submitting, the runner checks the live count and stops if it is at
  the cap; set this to whatever leaves room under your cluster's
  per-user policy.
- **Lockfile.** If the previous run is still in flight (a slow
  `squeue` or `sacct`, or batchq itself spawning a server), the new
  cron tick exits immediately instead of starting a second runner.
- **Append-only log.** Every tick prints a `--` separator and a
  timestamp, so the log is greppable when you need to know what the
  runner was doing at 03:14.
- **`--slurm-recover-hostless`** self-heals claims that got stuck
  `RUNNING` without ever reaching `sbatch` (see [Recovering orphaned
  claims](#recovering-orphaned-claims)). It's safe here precisely
  because this cron runner is the sole thing claiming against the
  server; drop it if you ever add a second runner on this server.

The lockfile is just a flag file, not a real lock — it's racy in
principle, but cron at minute granularity gives you plenty of time
between checks, and the worst case is a leftover lock after a crash
(which is easy to spot and delete).

### Continuously, with `--forever`

```sh
batchq run --slurm --slurm-max-jobs 200 --forever
```

The same reconciliation loop runs continuously instead of one pass per
invocation. There is no lockfile to manage and no scheduler to set up
— but you do have to keep the process alive, typically under `tmux` or
`nohup`, and that is where this shape gets awkward.

**Don't do this on a shared HPC login or submit node.** Most cluster
sysadmins frown on long-running user processes there; some kill them
automatically, and you will annoy people. Use cron on those clusters.

`--forever` is appropriate when:

- You own the host (a personal workstation, your own VM, a dedicated
  submit box).
- The host's policy explicitly allows long-running user processes.
- You are running batchq in front of a single-user SLURM install (so
  the "annoy the other users" concern doesn't apply).

In every other case, prefer cron.

## Operating tips

- **One runner per user.** There is no point in running two SLURM
  runners for the same user — they would compete for the same SLURM
  queue budget. Two for different users is fine.
- **Watch the rate.** Submitting too fast can be unfriendly to the
  SLURM scheduler. A handful of submissions per second is a reasonable
  default; if your sysadmins ask you to slow down, lower
  `max_slurm_jobs` so the runner waits more often between submissions,
  or lower `--max-jobs` so each cron tick submits fewer.

## Where to go next

- [Submitting jobs](submitting-jobs.md) — every flag the SLURM runner
  picks up at submission time, including the `#SBATCH` parsing
  shortcut.
- [Job arrays](job-arrays.md) — how `--array` is proxied as one
  `sbatch --array` and reconciled with one `sacct`.
- [Generic resources](resources.md) — `--gres`/`-C` mapping and how
  cluster labels route jobs to a SLURM runner.
- [Configuration](configuration.md) — every `[slurm_runner]` knob.
- [Remote access](remote.md) — if your CLI users are on a different
  machine than the SLURM submit host, point them at a reverse-proxied
  batchq server.
